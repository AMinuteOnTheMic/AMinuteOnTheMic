Thanks for joining me on this adventure! This doc will be updated with the most current guidelines and details on how to participate.

## Question Crowdsourcing Process

The call for questions will go out once a week on the hashtag `#AMinuteOnTheMic` on Twitter. For now, these posts are going out on my [personal account](https://twitter.com/nimbinatus).

## Video Guidelines

- Videos *MUST* be 60 seconds or less (59.99 seconds, the three nines of mic time). I will completely cut you off otherwise, and I may skip your video completely.
- Record in landscape.
- Save in `mp4` format.
- Please confirm that your video loads in a common player (and let me know which one in your banner doc) before submitting. VLC is a good example of a common player that I can access.
- Record in as high a quality as you can. The lowest framerate I can accept is 30 fps.
- Script:
  - "Hi, I'm `<name>`" (optional: add "from `<company>`"). Then answer the question. Do NOT repeat the question then answer, just answer.
- Filename: Last-First-Keyword-Date
  - I will provide the keyword when opening up the sharing link.

## Submission Process

- Drop your video in the sharing link provided.
- Add a text file that has your full name, twitter handle, and company as you'd like it on your name banner over the lower third of your video. Filename: Last-First-Keyword-Date-Banner.txt
- RT the next submission question call to help the next round.

## What if I want to add someone to the list of answerers?

Have them fill out the same Google Form you did! If you don't have the link, DM me.
