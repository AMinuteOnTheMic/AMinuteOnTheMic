A Minute on the Mic is a curated video series where the curator ([Laura Santamaria](https://twitter.com/nimbinatus))
takes a crowd-sourced question from Twitter, finds experts, and gives each expert a chance to answer the question in one
minute in a recorded response. Then, all of those responses are compiled into a single video and released for everyone
to watch.

In curating these videos, I hope that we can start getting a sense of how we collectively work, how we collectively
think, and how we collectively can go do great things.
